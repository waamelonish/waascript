# waascript
get official waascript files right here
# setup
you need .NET 10 for this to run as its made on VB.NET (sorry but i am NOT EVER TOUCHING C++ I SWEAR) as its not bundled
create 2 shortcuts for the interpreter and the editor..that sucks but will do
make sure to link the shortcut to the files!!!
**warning PLEASE DO NOT DELETE ANY FILES,THE PROGRAM WILL BREAK**
ok so NOW if you run without .NET it might..MIGHT prompt you do download it,do so if you like wasting your storage!
when you are done you can proceed to tutorial
# tutorial
open your editor,if you deleted it congrats you will use notepad!!! but there IS no difference
quick things: semicolon (;) is used to mark the end of a command
type this into the editor: windowNew(250 250 Hello); heres a brief explanation: windowNew tells interpreter to spawn a window, 250 250 is size and are seperated by spaces,the Hello is just the title
now you might see this when you open the file or something similar
[DEBUG] Parsed command blah blah 
or saying it ran
now add this to your program: print(hello);
now IDK WHY BUT...but....uhhhhhmm..............UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
it includes the print,stupid visual basic >:( im planning to use C# for 0.0.2
anyways your code SHOULD look like this:
windowNew(250 250 Hello);
print(hello);
now add: spawnLabel(0 0 Label);
it spawns a label...WOW
so your code would look like this:
windowNew(250 250 Hello);
print(hello);
spawnLabel(0 0 Label);
congrats you made a program,read releases for added commands
# why?
i am determined to make a programming language EVEN CLOSER TO NATURAL HUMAN LANGUAGE!
and then waascript was born
this is my first successful attempt at waascript using VB.NET....like i said i want to use C# but thats hard. VB.NET already has plenty of stuff,ill use C# for more complicated stuff
thanks for reading this and wasting your time :D
